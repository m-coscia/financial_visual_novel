## About the Project
### ‚ú®Inspiration
As young students, we constantly make financial decisions that impact our future. Being more visual, we believe that a visual novel offers a more interactive and personal experience to predict one‚Äôs spending behavior. Imagine you have access to a fun, engaging and game-like simulation that can provide you with a general idea of how responsible you are with your earnings.<br>
With the growing popularity of interactive visual novels, we introduce you, Financial Visual Novel GAM, a platform that allows users to predict the type of spender they are based on their daily decisions.<br>
### üß≠ What it does
With Visual , you can keep clicking to keep the text, graphics and sound moving as if you are turning a page of a book, while making narrative choices along the way. <br>
### ‚öôÔ∏è How we built it
We used a game engine called RenPy, which is a python based visual novel engine.<br> 
### üöß Challenges we ran into
It was quite difficult to get familiar with using the game engine at first.  We ran into a lot of image transformation issues, seeing as we do not have too much experience with image manipulation or computer graphics. In addition, we had to explore the world of storytelling in order to come up with a realistic story about the daily life of a young adult and student. <br>
### üèÜ Accomplishments that we're proud of
We're definitely very proud to have turned this idea into a working prototype. Seeing an idea come to life is an immense amount of joy. We‚Äôre able to come up with a story in a short period of time, and we‚Äôre also proud of ourselves for learning a new visual novel engine. We are truly blessed to have had the opportunity to work together with such talented, patient, and organized team members.
